The issue is that you have **TWO versions** of your project:

### **❌ OLD SCATTERED STRUCTURE** (at root):
```
C:\Users\hemja\OneDrive\Desktop\sticky_note_new\
├── admin.py                    # ❌ Should be in app folder
├── models.py                   # ❌ Should be in app folder  
├── tests.py                    # ❌ Should be in app folder
├── views.py                    # ❌ Should be in app folder
├── manage.py                   # ❌ Wrong location
└── ... (scattered files)
```

### **✅ CORRECT STRUCTURE** (in sticky_notes_project/):
```
C:\Users\hemja\OneDrive\Desktop\sticky_note_new\sticky_notes_project\
├── manage.py                   # ✅ CORRECT: At root level
├── requirements.txt            # ✅ CORRECT: At root level
├── sticky_notes_project/       # ✅ CORRECT: Project config
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
└── notes/                      # ✅ CORRECT: App directory
    ├── tests.py               # ✅ CORRECT: Tests in app folder!
    ├── models.py              # ✅ CORRECT: Models in app folder
